% To use the Erlang support module, the environment variable ROOTDIR

% so the etp-commands file becomes:
%     $ROOTDIR/erts/etc/unix/etp-commands
% Also, erl and erlc must be in the path.

% so the etp-commands file becomes:
%     $ROOTDIR/erts/etc/unix/etp-commands
% Also, erl and erlc must be in the path.

% Use etp-help for a command overview and general help.

% To use the Erlang support module, the environment variable ROOTDIR
% must be set to the toplevel installation directory of Erlang/OTP,
% so the etp-commands file becomes:
%     $ROOTDIR/erts/etc/unix/etp-commands
% Also, erl and erlc must be in the path.
